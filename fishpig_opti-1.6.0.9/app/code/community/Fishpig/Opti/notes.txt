CHANGELOG
- 1.6.0.9
- Fix for certain file paths that don't get minified.

- 1.6.0.8
- Fixed CSS minification for CSS files that contain data URIs. These were previously treated as relative URLs but are now left alone.

- 1.6.0.7
- Modified comment removal to work properly with hole punching in Bolt. Comments are still removed from the HTML but not until after Bolt has punched the holes.

- 1.6.0.6
- Improved HTML minification in a way that will minify the HTML more than ever. It's highly recommend that you use Opti with a Full Page Cache so that the HTML minification is cached for each request.

- 1.6.0.5
- Added a basic comment remover from the HTML minification. This removes the comments used by Bolt (these aren't needed by the time the request gets to the client).

- 1.6.0.4
- Improved the HTML minification so that most speed report scores for Minify HTML will go from 99 to 100.

- 1.6.0.3
- Added opti/source_blocks configuration node so that custom 'page/html_head' blocks can be placed around your site and compressed using this extension.

- 1.6.0.2
- A configuration option has been added that will enable minifying inline CSS. When enabled, any style tags on your site will be minified. This option comes enabled by default.

- 1.6.0.0
- The minified JS and CSS file names have been changed to a hash of file related data which includes the time the file was last edited. This means that each time you update a CSS or JS file, the cached version will automatically be recreated. With this feature, you no longer have to manually clear the cached files each time you make a change.
